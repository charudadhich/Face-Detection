The definition of face detection refers to computer technology that is able to identify the presence of peopleâ€™s faces within digital images.

In this project, a simple Face Detection system can be generated using python coding, machine learning, open cv library and haar cascade. I have used both images and video capturing mode which detects face of a person and shows it with a rectangle over their face.

Libraries: OpenCV (https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

XMl File: HaarCascade(https://github.com/kipr/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)
